# Big Data Basics

*by [BigBoards](http://bigboards.io)*

This stack accompanies the Big Data course at [Avans Hogeschool](http://www.avans.nl/)
The Big Data course contains a practical project on how to build a complete **data processing pipeline**. The workshop is **hands-on** using a [BigBoards Cube](http://bigboards.io/orderprototype). You will be touching **several common Big Data technologies**.

The accompanying [repository](https://github.com/bigboards/bb-stack-avans), contains all the technologies, resources and solutions to complete the workshop.

During this workshop, you can

- **ingest** data from a rather large **relational database**
- **store** the raw data on **distributed file system** as your primary data;
- **restructure** the data for **easier analysis**;
- and finally apply **machine learning** to build e.g. a **recommendation engine**.

## Big Data technologies

We have packaged the most common technologies as a [BigBoards stack](http://hive.bigboards.io/#/library/stack/google-oauth2-103728492012393057640/bb-stack-avans). With the click of a button you can install everything on your BigBoards device. Just head over to the [BigBoards Hive](http://hive.bigboards.io).

The technologies which you can use to build your end-to-end data pipeline, are:

- [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) for distributed storage, processing and resource management, 
- [Apache Sqoop](http://sqoop.apache.org/) for ingestion of relational data, 
- [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/) to write data transformations, 
- [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) to query data on the distributed filesystem, 
- [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) for lightning fast data processing, 
- [Apache Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/) for uniform data access, 
- [Apache Spark MLlib](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/) for machine learning. 

For now, we still host the data external to the big data clusters.

## User access

To access the device and technologies, we have linke the installed UIs on the dashboards if the stack is installed:

- [Yarn]() allow the user to get status on running Hadoop applications.
- [HDFS]() allow the user to get status on HDFS and read-onlly access to the directory tree.
- [MR History]() allow the user to get status on finished Hadoop applications.  
- [Notebooks](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/) notebooks to interactively write and run programs on your device. Available kernels:
    - [PySpark]() to interactively run Spark pipelines
    - [Terminal]() for command-line access. Simply run `hadoop-shell` for full access to the Hadoop environment, incl. Pig, Scoop and Hive
- [Hue-filesystem]() for web access to the HDFS file system (TBD)

## Practical
You can login to the notebooks environment with the default BigBoards username (`bb`) and password (`Swh^bdl`)
